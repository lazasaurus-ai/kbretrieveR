Description: Provides a thin R interface for AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases 
    using the 'paws' SDK. Includes helpers for retrieval-only calls, 
    retrieval-and-generate (RAG), and a unified client that can combine 
    KB context with an 'ellmer' chat object. Designed for simple RAG flows 
    returning tidy tibbles with answers, citations, and raw responses.
